<p>Things we changed:<br>
Our web application does not have the option to create a user\'92s fantasy team.<br>
Our web application only contains NBA players from the years 2000 to 2014.<br>
Our web application does not have the option for NBA stats trivia.<br>
</p>
<p>Helpful information for next time:<br>
Some images in our web application become altered when using Google Chrome. The browser that works best with our web application is Firefox.<br>
A better introduction on how to use CSS.<br>
A better understanding of the complexity of creating certain functions. We definitely thought we would be able to implement more functions than were realistic for our knowledge base and time frame.<br>
